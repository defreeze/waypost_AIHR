Fact-based decision-making is the new norm in successful and innovative HR organizations. But the insights gathered from low-quality data are barely better than gut feeling. If there\u2019s any doubt about the integrity of your input data, stakeholders will question every result you present them. That's why we need to avoid any doubts about the integrity and availability of your HR data. By learning to assess the quality of your HR data and how to implement changes to improve data integrity, you are giving your organization access to a powerful strategic resource \u2014 and you will be prepared when someone questions the integrity of your data. Why is this course not sold individually? To optimize the quality of your learning experience, the Global HR Data Integrity course is not available for standalone enrollment. The course is part of our HR Metrics & Dashboarding Certificate Program and also included with the Full Academy Access License . Why is data integrity relevant to HR? Safeguarding the integrity of HR data requires more than just IT savvy and a solid understanding of global data privacy laws. When working with data sourced from multiple countries, you will soon run into challenges that are more cultural than digital. As the traditional stewards of organizational culture, HR professionals are ideally suited to helping achieve data integrity at a global scale.

The future of HR is data-driven. If you are one of the many HR professionals who are already working with HR data, being able to effectively communicate the stories hidden within vast amounts of data gives you and your organization a strategic competitive advantage. Data alone is just not enough. Decision-makers need clear and compelling insights, not endless rows and columns of unfiltered information. In this online course, you learn how to use data visualization techniques to find and reveal the stories within your HR data, so that you can provide the pivotal input that can influence strategic decisions and help your organization win in the marketplace. Why is this course not sold individually? To optimize the quality of your learning experience, the HR Data Visualization course is not available for standalone enrollment. The course is part of our HR Metrics & Dashboarding Certificate Program and also included with the Full Academy Access License . What is HR data visualization? HR data visualization is essentially the process of transforming raw data into meaningful visual stories presented in the form of insightful graphs, charts and dashboards. Because of the way our brain processes information, presenting data in a visual way helps us discover patterns and trends, making data visualization a much more effective way of conveying a story than overloading stakeholders with raw data. In order for HR to really become data-driven, information needs to be presented intuitively and accompanied by a clear story so that it becomes easy to use in the decision-making process. This means that in addition to a certain level of data literacy, you also need to understand how people process visual information, and how to explore data to uncover its story. Knowledge of various types of charts and graphs, and the pitfalls associated with them, is an essential part of creating effective and compelling visualizations of HR data.

I feel it is necessary for all HR people. Posted 1 year ago Verified Alumni Anonymous from United States The course I attended was for Diversity & Inclusion Certificate. I feel it was overcomplicated with lots of different theories which would be hard to implement across the board. This is my personal opinion. Diversity & inclusion is not easy but the processes to improve them should not be as difficult as this course portrayed. I feel like the language used in the modules could have been more simple and concise. This is my first course with AIHR and I doubt I will be taking anymore.
